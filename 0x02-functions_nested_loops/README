# functions and nested loops 

Project done during ** full stack software engineering studies**
at ** ALX School**,it aims to learn about header files,functions,loops and nested loops in *** C language.

##Technologies
*c files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
*c files are written according  to the c90 standard
*tessted on ubuntu 20.04 lts

##files
All files are written in c:

filename | description|
|----------|-----------|
| 0-putchar.c | prints putchar |
| 1-alphabet.c | prints the alphabrt in lower case |
| 2-print_alphabet_x10.c | prints 10 times the alphabet,in lowercase |
| 3-is lower c | checks for lower cas character |
| 4-isalpha.c | checks for alphabetic character |
| 5-sign.c | prints the sign of a number |
| 6-abs.c | computes the absolute value of an integer |
| 7-print_last_digit.c | prints the last digit of a number |
| 8-24_hours.c | prints every minute of the day |
| 9-times_table.c | prints the 9 times table,starting with 0 |
| 10-add.c |adds two intergers and returns the result |
| 11-print_to_98.c | prints all natural numbers from n to 98 |
